/*
 * 7. Write an application which defines a class named Child. Define the methods
 * and member variables for this class which enables a Child object to store/do
 * the following:
 * - the name of the child
 * - the childâ€™s birthday
 * - the child can introduce him/herself by "saying": Hello my name is ...
 * - the child can tell his/her age
 * - the child can add two numbers smaller than 10 and return the result like
 * so: The sum of X and Y is equal to Z
 * - the child knows how to say Goodbye!
 * - the child can speak the alphabet both in direct and inverse order
 * - the child can color a chess board given its dimensions by using
 * alternative colors (for the colors use the symbols 1 and 0)
 * - the child can play dots and crosses (X-0) by him/herself ðŸ˜Š (use the
 * application developed in the previous assignment)
 * Remarks: the childâ€™s name and birthday cannot be accessed from outside the
 * class.
 * All the information about a Child will be filled-in using a Child object and
 * its associated methods and variables. The interaction with the child will be
 * done through an object which is instantiated in the main method.
