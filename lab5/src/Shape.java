/*
 * 3. Develop a class hierarchy of shapes and write a program that computes the
 * amount of paint needed to paint different objects. The hierarchy will
 * consist of a parent class Shape with three derived classes - Sphere,
 * Rectangle, and Cylinder. For the purposes of this exercise, the only
 * attribute a shape will have is a name and the method of interest will be one
 * that computes the area of the shape (surface area in the case of
 * three-dimensional shapes).
 *
 * Do the following:
 * A. Write an abstract class Shape with the following members:
 * - an instance variable shapeName of String type
 * - an abstract method area()
 * - a toString() method that returns the name of the shape
 * B. The file Sphere.java contains the Sphere class which is a descendant of
 * Shape. A sphere has a radius as a private integer variable and implements
 * the body of the inherited abstract method area().
 * C. Define similar classes for a rectangle and a cylinder. The classes
 * Rectangle and Cylinder are also derived from the Shape class. A rectangle is
 * defined by its length and width. A cylinder is defined by a radius and height.
 * Note: Each of the derived classes override the toString method and define
 * specific mutator and accessor methods.
 * D. The file Paint.java contains an interface that has a float constant
 * paintPerSurfaceUnit.
 * E. The file PaintThings.java implements the Paint interface and contains a
 * program that computes the amount of paint needed to paint various shapes.
 * Instantiate the three shape objects: deck <- Rectangle, bigBall <- Sphere
 * and tank <- Cylinder. Make the appropriate method calls to assign each
 * objectâ€™s specific attributes with data read from the keyboard.
 * Compute the amount of paint needed for covering each created shape.
